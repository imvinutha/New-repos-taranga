                        <h2>Our Story<br><strong class="black"> Farm and company</strong></h2>

                       <p>Mr. Srinivas, the brain behind this venture, just wanted a change from the routine stressed-out life of pollution, noise and crowds. One of the options was to get away from this urban chaos.</br> 
                        But, with a graduation in engineering and experience in advertising, just running away from the city limits, Mr. Srinivas felt, would serve only a limited purpose for a limited time. Then, not doing anything would become another cause for a stressed existence after a busy life.</br>
                        So, he wanted to combine relaxation with an active life amidst nature. And, the decision was farming.</br>
                        A hunt for a suitable place ended up with a 00-acre plot, 00km off Magadi Main Road, a 00-hour drive from the city limits.</br>
                        In spite of the good-intentioned advice of the locals against buying this undulating barren land subject to frequent winds and rains leading to soil erosion, Mr. Srinivas took it up as a challenge to make the best out of a given thing.</br>
                        Starting with naming the venture as TARANGA, meaning ‘waves’ in Sanskrit, after the wavy features of the land, Mr. Srinivas set out to change things without disturbing the nature.</br>
                        As is known, energy cannot be created or destroyed but can only be converted from one form to another. So too, Mr. Srinivas felt, soil erosion can be curtailed and harnessed optimally without altering the topography.</br>
                        The boundary in the line of winds was fortified with root-bearing and spread-branches trees to prevent smaller plants from getting uprooted. Pits were dug up in the path of rain water so that both top soil and water get conserved. Add to this, vermiculture was adopted to enrich soil fertility.  </br>
                        With things slowly getting under control, methodical planning resulted in trifurcation of activities into animal husbandry, horticulture and nursery. There also is a plan to start yoga and other nature-driven training-programmes for a future date.
                        </p>
                        <h3><strong>Animal Husbandry</strong><br></h3>
                        <p>Our cows are pure breed of Gir kind brought in from Rajasthan. These cows have maintained their genetic pool from only one species nourished on natural feed. These cows, for generations, have been grazing the forest lands and have had no medical intervention, except for ayush type of dispensation. 
                            From the day these cows arrive at Taranga Farms, they continue to experience the same standard of nourishment and treatment. </br>
                            At Taranga Farms, from the moment a calf is born till it reaches the lactating stage to a time it stops producing milk to its completion of lifetime, every moment of its life would be as nature intended it to be. </br>
                            Calves are not separated from their mothers till the natural weaning- stage, nurtured on organic feed, provided with plenty of clean water, 
                            left unfettered, and treated with ayurvedic and homoeopathic medicines until and unless allopathic intervention is absolutely necessary. Unwell and diseased cows are kept separately till they recover.</br>
                            Flute music is played to make the cows and calves feel at ease at all times, be it the milking time, time for a stroll or just during resting. </br>
                        </p>
                        <h3><strong>Horticulture</strong><br></h3>
                        <p>Both medicinal and non-medicinal herbs and plants, close to a hundred varieties including exotic fruits and flowers, are grown here. A moment of pride is that saplings of XXXXX, a rare variety of fruit, once known for its availability to only the royals of Indonesia, has been imported for cultivation at our farm.</br>
                            Nourished with organic manure, 80% of the produce goes into processing as value-added products and the balance becomes part of the nursery.
                        </p>
                        <h3><strong>Nursery</strong><br></h3>
                        <p>It is not just any other nursery. We have 000 varieties of fruits, 000 vegetables, 000 ornamental plants and 000 types of medicinal herbs, saplings and seeds. We help the buyers with the right choice and train them in plant-rearing.
                        </p>

                        <h3>“Farming isn’t a battle against nature, but a partnership with it.” </br>
                            – Jeff Koehler </h3>
                        <h3><strong>Landscape</strong></br></h3>
                        <p>Topography of our farm land has had its undulating features retained with minimum alteration. Nature’s infinite wisdom in keeping the unevenness of the land to help save water and prevent erosion of upper layer of the soil has been respected by curtailing unnecessary superficial constructions except for a farm house and a servants’ quarter in a corner of the premises. By this, the soil content has neither diminished nor got disturbed.</br>
                        Additionally, the soil here is continually enriched with vermin-composts and natural manure produced at the farm itself. The water used is drawn from the bore well within the farm. All in all, it is like for nature, by nature and of nature!</br>
                        The farm boasts of four neem-trees, medicinal herbs, nutritional vegetation, one bore-well, one well-furnished farmhouse, servants’ quarter, all-weather cubicle-type cow-enclosures and sufficient number of faucets, sprinklers, etc. And, as part of security, CCTV has been installed at strategic points.
                        </p>
                        <h3><strong>Milk and Milk Products</strong></br></h3>
                        <p><strong>Current State of Milk</strong></br>
                            Don’t get carried away by claims of superiority of milk from cows nourished on non-organic feed, regularly injected with hormones, and kept in unhealthy conditions. Do not get impressed with dairy jargons like pasteurization and homogenization. They are one type of adulteration where milk from different cows, healthy and diseased, is mixed before being processed. On the ethical front, cows are treated no more than milk machines. The effects of human consumption of this type of milk (known as A1) are uncomfortable symptoms in our daily lives to life-threatening diseases.</br>
                            Milk from Taranga Farms, naturally, is safe for the body, ethical to the soul and economical to the pocket.</br>
                            You can be assured of quality of milk products too from our farms. Ghee, cheese, butter, butter milk, curd, etc. from our farms are just the products for shelf-life, odourlessness, better taste and nutritional value.
                        </p>
                        <h3><strong>Byproducts</strong></br></h3>
                        <p>Cow dung from our farm makes for organic manure. Cow-dung ash is best suited as dishwasher and ingredient for incense sticks, Cow urine has its own medicinal benefits, more so when it is totally organic in nature. Cow products have radiation-absorbent qualities.</p>
